# Senate Scraper

A tool to retrieve the email addresses of the current Italian senators.

This should not be used in an automated setting, but is a tool that permits
citizens and residents of Italy to more easily access their representatives.

The Senate is elected on a regional basis, and although there is not the same
"constituency link" as in some countries the possibility to contact elected
representatives is important.
